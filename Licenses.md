# Licensing & Pricing

This page explains how licensing works for the **WorkforceVision** Power BI visual, including how to purchase, assign, and manage licences through Microsoft AppSource and the Microsoft 365 admin centre. A License is required to be assigned to all users of the visual both developers in Power BI Desktop and viewers/users in Power BI Service.

## 1. Where and how to purchase licences

All licence purchases are managed **directly by Microsoft** through **Microsoft AppSource**. To compare quotes or purchase licenses:

1. Go to the AppSource listing:  
   👉 [Org Chart Drag and Drop](https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/power-bi-visuals/workforcevision.org-chart-drag-and-drop?tab=PlansAndPrice)
2. Select **“Buy Now”**.
3. Choose the plan that matches the number of licences you need.
4. Select **monthly** or **annual** billing.
5. Follow the checkout process until the **Payment** section to see the total monthly or annual cost.

We offer several plans based on the number of licences required (e.g., 1–10, 11–200, 200–500, 500–1199, etc.).
Larger tiers provide a **more cost-effective** price per licence, and annual billing offers the best value compared with monthly billing.

In many cases, it can be more economical to choose a larger plan than your exact user count, as the lower price per licence often reduces the overall cost. This also gives you flexibility and a buffer if your number of users increases over time.

If you’d like to compare pricing across plans, you can:

- Click **“Buy now”** on the AppSource listing.
- Select a plan and proceed to the Payment step.
- Compare the **monthly vs annual** totals before confirming the purchase.

## 2. How licence assignment works

When you purchase licences under your organisation’s billing account, your company receives that number of licences, which can then be assigned to users or groups via the [Microsoft 365 admin centre](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/licenses).

For example:

> If you purchase **11 licences** on the  
> **“WorkforceVision Org Chart (11–200 Licences)”** plan,  
> your organisation will receive **11 assignable licences**.

You can manage these licences here:

👉 **Licences – Microsoft 365 admin center**  
`https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/licenses`

Licences are:

- **Owned by the organisation**, not by individual users.
- **Assigned to users or groups**, similar to Microsoft products (e.g. Teams or Microsoft 365 licences).
- **Reassignable** – if an employee leaves, IT can unassign their licence and reassign it to a new starter.

Many IT teams already have **automated processes** for assigning and unassigning Microsoft licences. The same automation can typically be extended to include the WorkforceVision Org Chart licences.

## 3. How licences are used in Power BI

Once a user has a licence assigned:

- They can use the visual in **any workspace** within your tenant.
- They can use the visual in **multiple reports and dashboards** – there is **no limit** on the number of reports a licensed user can build or view with the visual.

Important points:

- Licences are assigned to **users**, not tied to a **specific workspace**.
- If all licensed users (for example, 10 users on a 10-licence plan) have licences assigned, each of those users can access and use the visual in **any workspace** they have permission to access.

---

## 4. Tenants & sharing

As with most Microsoft licences:

- Licences **cannot be shared across tenants**.
- Licences purchased under your organisation’s billing account are **restricted to your tenant only**.

If you collaborate with external organisations or clients, they would need licences within **their own tenant** if they want to develop or extensively use the visual there.

## 5. Changing plans & purchasing additional licences

### 5.1 Increasing your licence count

If you need more licences and you move into a new tier, it is generally best to:

1. **Cancel** your existing subscription/plan in the [Microsoft 365 admin centre Subscriptions](https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/subscriptions).
2. **Purchase a new plan** at the higher tier through AppSource.

This is because:

- Plans typically **cannot be amended** once active.
- Moving to a higher tier can be **more cost-effective** than trying to top up within a lower tier.

**Example scenario (1a):**

- Your organisation currently has **250 licences** on the  
  **“WorkforceVision Org Chart (200–500 Licences)”** plan.
- You now require **270 licences**.

In this case, the recommended approach is:

1. Cancel the **200–500 Licences** plan in  
   👉 **Your products – Microsoft 365 admin center**  
   `https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal/Home#/subscriptions`
2. Purchase a **500-licence** plan under the  
   **“WorkforceVision Org Chart (500–1199 Licences)”** tier in AppSource.

This is typically **more cost-effective** than purchasing exactly 270 licences within the 200–500 tier.

### 5.2 Cancelling and starting a new plan

Key points:

- **Plans generally cannot be amended** once they have started.
- To change tiers, the recommended approach is to **cancel the current plan** and **start a new one**.
- The **auto-renewal date** is based on the **plan’s start date**.
- There is **no cancellation fee**.
- You can **cancel and start a new plan on the same day**.

## 6. What happens if you run out of licences?

The behaviour depends on how your IT team has configured licence assignment, but typically:

- The system will **not automatically purchase new licences** unless it has been explicitly configured to do so.
- If a user attempts to use the visual **without a licence**, they may see an **message** in the visual prompting them to **purchase or request a licence**.
- In most standard setups, this **does not trigger an automatic purchase** of additional licences.

If you’re unsure how your organisation handles this, we recommend checking with your **IT or licensing team**.

## 7. Large purchases & private plans

If you’re considering a **large licence purchase**, we may be able to offer a **private plan at a reduced rate**.

- For high-volume scenarios (e.g. large enterprises or multi-country roll-outs), please **contact us** (irawatt@workforcevision.co.uk) to discuss options.
- We can work with you to find the most **cost-effective licensing structure** and, where appropriate, arrange a **private offer** via AppSource.

> 💬 *If your clients have specific feature requests or you need further detail on licences, plans, or subscriptions, please feel free to reach out – we’re happy to help.*

## 8. Tax Exemptions

All purchases made through Microsoft AppSource are processed directly by Microsoft. This means that any tax exemptions or reductions must be applied by Microsoft at the billing-account level see [billing tax-and-tax-exemptions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/billing/tax-and-tax-exemptions).
If your organisation qualifies for tax-exempt purchasing, please contact your Microsoft support representative or billing administrator to ensure your exemption is correctly set up and applied at checkout.
